# Build Process

## Circuits
I am not an electronics engineer. 
The vast majority of the circuits I have used in these modules, have been found in various places around the web. 
For each module in the synth I have recreated the circuit in [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/eagle/free-download) and designed my own PCB.
The Eagle project files I created will be included in this project along with a link to the original source of the circuit.

## PCBs
I don't make my own PCBs (Having tried and not really being impressed with the results). 
All of my PCBs to date have been manufactured using [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/). 
It's very easy to just upload your Eagle PCB design files, and they are good quality PCBs.

## Panels
Panels are made from Aluminium Composite Sheet (also known as Dibond or Alupanel). 
This consists of two layers of aluminium with acrylic between them, which has then been painted on both sides.
It can be found easily online, cut to size. It is also quite cheap and easy to cut.

I use an [X-Carve](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve) carving machine to make the holes in the panels.

I also use an engraving bit in the X-Carve for drawing the text.

The panels have been designed using [V-Carve](https://www.vectric.com/products/vcarve.htm) software.

## Case

The case is made from wood, using [MakerBeam](https://www.makerbeam.com/) for the rails which the panels are screwed to.
